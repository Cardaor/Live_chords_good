# Live_chords

A project of mine to make a karaoke like application for playing guitar. 
The goal is to see which song you are currently playing on spotify 
and showing the lyrics of the song and the chords to play like in a karaoke.
Meaning that the lines of lyrics and chords scroll up with the song.

At the moment you still have to synchronise these songs manually.
To enter 'synchronising' mode, press space once, than press space for each line according to the song untill the end.
This timing information will be stored and the next time you play the song, the screen will scroll up.

To add your spotify account info, to go spotify.com and login to your account.
See if you can make your account into a developer account and create a simple application. 
I suggest just following a youtube tutorial.
When you have followed the steps and can get acces to a client-id and clientsecret,
add your information in the file Save_account_info.py and run that file once.
This will create a account_info.txt file with your account info 

To get a simple printout of lyrics and chords on a console, use live_chords.py
For the actual application 'front_end' use Pygame_UI_test.py.... Yeah original name

Make sure there is a folder called 'tabs' in the same folder as where these scripts are, (should be there when cloning this repo)

Any suggestions are always welcome, though i can't promise quickly working on it :)
